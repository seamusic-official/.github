### ‚úçÔ∏è About
SeaMusic is a social network for working between producers and artists. 
   Every artist needs a beat, mixing and all the other services of a producer so that his voice sounds high-quality and can compete with other artists in quality and individuality. With rare exceptions, the work of an artist without a producer is very problematic and at the same time, there are no decent services for their collaboration either. Producers have to upload beats to YouTube, which are not intended for music at all, drop bits to artists' emails or to their mini-shops on social networks or websites scattered on the Internet, and artists have to choose among this huge variety without adequate filtering and guarantees that the seller will be adequate and will not be a fraud. There are plenty of risks and inconveniences for both sides, especially for beginners in this industry, but SeaMusic is ready to help them.
